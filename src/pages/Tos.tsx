          <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
          <p>Last Updated: Jan 18, 2025</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to Etch.Social (“the Service,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), operated by
            Ownerfy Inc. By accessing or using our Service, you agree to these Terms of
            Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not access or use the Service.
            Please read these Terms carefully.
          </p>
          <h2>1. OVERVIEW OF OUR SERVICE</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Description</h3>
          <p>
            Etch.Social is a social networking platform similar to Twitter and TikTok with
            additional blockchain and Nostr protocol components. You can post content
            (“User Content”), communicate with other users, and earn or purchase credits
            for certain features.
          </p>
          <h3>1.2 Data on the Blockchain or Nostr Protocol</h3>
          <p>
            Certain portions of data (including, but not limited to, public user posts,
            likes, and interactions) may be recorded on a blockchain or the Nostr
            protocol. This data is publicly accessible and may not be fully deletable once
            it has been written.
          </p>
          <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Age Requirement</h3>
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By using the Service,
            you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age.
          </p>
          <h3>2.2 Account Registration</h3>
          <p>
            You may need to create an account to use certain features. You agree to
            provide accurate and complete information and to update it as necessary. You
            are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
            credentials (e.g., username, password).
          </p>
          <h3>2.3 User Credentials and Private Messages</h3>
          <p>
            Your login credentials and private messages are not publicly visible. However,
            you acknowledge that any other content you post or share may be public,
            particularly if stored on the blockchain or via the Nostr protocol.
          </p>
          <h2>3. PUBLIC NATURE OF CONTENT</h2>
          <h3>3.1 Public Content</h3>
          <p>
            All data, except private messages and user credentials, is considered public.
            This includes, but is not limited to, posts, comments, likes, and reposts.
            Once published on the blockchain or Nostr protocol, such data may be
            accessible to anyone with the technical ability to view it.
          </p>
          <h3>3.2 Irrevocability of Public Content</h3>
          <p>
            If your content is recorded on a blockchain or the Nostr protocol, it may be
            impossible to completely remove or alter once it is added. While we will honor
            requests to remove content from our servers, we cannot guarantee removal from
            third-party services, nodes, or blockchain records.
          </p>
          <h3>3.3 No Guarantee of Erasure</h3>
          <p>
            While we strive to comply with applicable data protection laws, you
            acknowledge that once data is written to certain blockchain systems, neither
            we nor any other party may be able to remove or alter that data. Where erasure
            requests are valid under applicable law, we will use reasonable efforts to
            address them through measures such as key revocation or rendering off-chain
            data inaccessible, but we cannot guarantee full erasure in the case of
            on-chain records.
          </p>
          <h2>4. CONTENT USAGE AND REMOVAL</h2>
          <h3>4.1 User-Generated Content</h3>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for the User Content you post. By posting content,
            you represent and warrant you have the right to post it and that it does not
            violate these Terms or any applicable law.
          </p>
          <h3>4.2 User Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for any personal data or sensitive information that
            you include in the content you submit. We strongly discourage posting personal
            data or information that you may later wish to remove.
          </p>
          <h3>4.3 Content Removal and Moderation</h3>
          <p>
            We strive to allow freedom of expression and will not censor or remove content
            unless it violates the law or these Terms. However, we reserve the right to
            remove or restrict any content on our servers at our sole discretion. Any
            content deemed to be in violation of these Terms or the law may be removed at
            any time without prior notice or liability to you.
          </p>
          <h3>4.4 Illegal Activities</h3>
          <p>
            You may not use the Service for any purpose that is illegal in your
            jurisdiction or that violates any law or regulation. We may report any such
            violations to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
          </p>
          <h3>4.5 Altering Smart Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to alter or remove any smart contracts we have deployed
            for the Service. This may include changing the terms under which smart
            contracts operate, modifying how credits or tokens function, or
            decommissioning contracts entirely, at our discretion.
          </p>
          <h2>5. USAGE OF CREDITS AND PAYMENTS</h2>
          <h3>5.1 Purchasing Credits</h3>
          <p>
            You may purchase credits to access certain features of the Service. All
            purchases are final.
          </p>
          <h3>5.2 No Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            No refunds will be provided for any unused or remaining credits. If you choose
            to stop using the Service or your account is terminated for violating these
            Terms, you will not receive a refund for any credits.
          </p>
          <h3>5.3 Pricing and Changes</h3>
          <p>
            We may change our prices, packages, or credit offerings at any time. We will
            attempt to provide reasonable notice of any changes but are under no
            obligation to do so.
          </p>

            confidential to the extent that we are able; however, you acknowledge the
            inherent risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.
          </p>
          <h3>7.2 Public Availability</h3>
          <p>
            By using our Service, you acknowledge that any data stored on public

          <p>
            If asked to comply, we will remove all personal data from our servers.
            However, as stated above, once data is recorded on a blockchain or the Nostr
            protocol, we cannot guarantee its removal from those systems or from any
            third-party services that replicate such data.
          </p>
