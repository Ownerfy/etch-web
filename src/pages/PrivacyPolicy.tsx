          <p>
            Welcome to Etch.Social (the “Site,” “Platform,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), owned
            and operated by Ownerfy Inc. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
            disclose, and protect your information when you use our services, websites,
            and applications (collectively, the “Services”).
          </p>
          <p>
            By using Etch.Social, you agree to the collection and use of your information
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. If you do not
            agree, please do not use the Services.
          </p>
          <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Personal Information You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Account Registration:</strong> When you create an account, we may
            collect information such as your username, email address, and any profile
            information you provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>User Content:</strong> Any content, comments, posts, or other
            materials you share on the Platform (except for private messages) may be
            publicly visible, stored on our servers, and potentially recorded on a
            blockchain or the Nostr protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us (e.g., via email or support
            forms), we may collect your name, contact information, and the content of your
            message.
          </p>
          <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information about how you access
            and use our Services, such as your IP address, browser type, device
            information, pages visited, and referring website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies, web
            beacons, and other tracking technologies to remember your preferences, improve
            site performance, analyze usage, and personalize your experience. You can set
            your browser to refuse cookies, but this may limit certain features of the
            Services.
          </p>
          <h3>1.3 Blockchain and Nostr Protocol Data</h3>
          <p>
            Certain user actions and content (e.g., posts or interactions) may be recorded
            on blockchain networks or via the Nostr protocol. This data is public and
            immutable, meaning anyone with the technical ability may access and
            potentially replicate it indefinitely.
          </p>
          <h3>1.4 Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>
            We may integrate or link to third-party services (e.g., analytics, payment
            processors, or social media). Such services may collect information subject to
            their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review each third party’s
            privacy practices.
          </p>
          <h2>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>We use the collected information to:</p>

            <li>
              Improve and Customize: Understand how users interact with the Services,

              Communicate with You: Send you updates, security alerts, and administrative
              messages, as well as respond to your inquiries or requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enforce Policies: Prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Service, comply with
              legal obligations, and protect the rights, property, or safety of
              Etch.Social, its users, or others.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
          <h3>3.1 Public Disclosure via Blockchain and Nostr</h3>
          <p>
            Any content recorded on a blockchain or via the Nostr protocol is public and
            cannot be fully removed or altered once it is written.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are unable to control how third parties (e.g., blockchain explorers, node
            operators) may access, use, or store this public data.
          </p>
          <h3>3.2 Service Providers and Partners</h3>
          <p>
            We may share information with trusted third-party providers who assist us in
            operating our Platform, conducting our business, or providing services on our
            behalf. These third parties are contractually obligated to keep your
            information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we
            disclose it to them.
          </p>
          <h3>3.3 Legal Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to
            valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders, subpoenas).
          </p>
          <h3>3.4 Business Transfers</h3>
          <p>
            If Ownerfy Inc. or Etch.Social is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset
            sale, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred or disclosed as part
            of that transaction, subject to any legal requirements and limitations.
          </p>
          <h2>4. DATA RETENTION</h2>
          <p>
            We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill
            the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period
            is required or permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Server Removal:</strong> If you request deletion of your account, we
            will remove your personal data from our servers to the extent possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Blockchain and Nostr Limitations:</strong> We cannot remove data that
            has already been stored on a blockchain or via the Nostr protocol, as these
            systems are decentralized and not under our control.
          </p>
          <h2>5. YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS</h2>
          <h3>5.1 Access, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal
            information stored on our servers. To do so, please contact us at the email
            below. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Blockchain Exceptions:</strong> Please note that once data is written
            to a blockchain or the Nostr protocol, it may not be fully removable. We can
            only remove such data from our servers, but we cannot erase it from
            third-party nodes or ledgers.
          </p>
          <h3>5.2 Opt-Out of Communications</h3>
          <p>
            You may opt out of receiving promotional or marketing emails from us by
            following the instructions in those emails or by contacting us. However, we
            may still send administrative emails (e.g., account alerts, security notices).
          </p>
          <h3>5.3 Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Most browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies. If you choose to block
            cookies, some features of our Services may not function properly.
          </p>
          <h3>5.4 Do Not Track</h3>
          <p>
            Our Services may not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser
            because there is no industry-standard approach.
          </p>
          <h2>6. SECURITY</h2>
          <p>
            We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
            measures designed to protect your personal information against unauthorized
            access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over
            the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. You use our Services
            at your own risk.
          </p>
          <h2>7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
          <p>
            If you access our Services from outside the jurisdiction where our servers are
            located, your information may be transferred across international borders. By
            using Etch.Social, you consent to the transfer of your information to
            countries that may have data protection laws different from your country of
            residence.
          </p>
          <h2>8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
          <p>
            Etch.Social is not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If you become
            aware that a minor under 18 has provided us with personal information, please
            contact us, and we will take steps to remove such information from our
            servers.
          </p>
          <h2>9. POLICY UPDATES</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. When
            we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top. Your continued use
            of the Services after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the
            updated Privacy Policy.
